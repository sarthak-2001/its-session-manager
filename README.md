# ITS Session Manager

## Why?

We all have faced issues with ITS disconnecting abruptly while we are middle of streaming or downloading the file. This script helps u stay connected to ITS as long as u want.

## How to use?

1. Replace line `22` with `college ID` and line `25` with `ITS password`.
2. Update chromedriverpath in line `15`.

```
python its_login.py
```
